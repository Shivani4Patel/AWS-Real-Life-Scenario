# AWS Real Life Scenarios

Welcome to the **AWS Real Life Scenarios** repository! This repository contains practical solutions and examples for various cloud computing challenges (which i learned using AWS Skill builder  SimuLearn ) solved using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The scenarios range from core cloud computing concepts to highly available architectures, application scaling, networking, databases, and security best practices.

This project serves as a guide for those looking to learn and implement AWS services in real-world environments.

## Overview

This repository showcases solutions for common and advanced scenarios using AWS technologies. Each folder represents a distinct scenario with hands-on labs, configuration files, and step-by-step instructions.

By going through these scenarios, you will learn how to:
- Set up highly available applications
- Secure cloud infrastructure
- Scale applications dynamically based on load
- Manage cloud economics and budgeting
- Work with databases and file systems in the cloud
